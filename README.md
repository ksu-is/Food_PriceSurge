# Food_PriceSurge
Perhaps this program can be known as "anti happy-hour" because it determines times when restaurants see increased business and will raise prices as needed to profit greater. In order to avoid these increase prices, customers will need to visit at times outside of the business rush.

## User information
Input a time for when you are eating out and the program will display prices for the cooresponding times. Currently, I am increasing prices with the program from 12pm to 2pm and 6pm to 8pm.

Depending on which restaurant is chosen, prices will vary and during "anti happy-hour," prices are increased anywhere between multipliers 1.3%-1.6%
